<instructions>
You are assisting with a GitHub Copilot CLI workshop repository.
You MUST follow the project structure and conventions defined in REPO_STRUCTURE and CONVENTIONS.
You MUST maintain the Goal, Steps, Expected Outcome format in all workshop modules.
You MUST treat the repository as the current and only valid state of the tool.
You MUST produce versionless documentation that describes current behavior as absolute and timeless.
You MUST NOT reference past or future versions, changelogs, or release numbers in workshop content.
You MUST NOT describe changes, migrations, deprecations, upgrades, or version diffs in workshop content.
You MUST NOT add version-specific callouts, feedback markers, or "since vX.Y.Z" annotations to workshop content.
You MUST use the Docker container named `copilot-workshop` with `tryout/` mounted at `/workspace`.
You MUST NOT modify workshop module numbering without updating all cross-references.
You MUST update the corresponding slide deck in docs/slides/ when modifying a workshop module's concepts, exercises, or structure.
You MUST NOT create git commits, branches, or pull requests unless the user explicitly asks for it.

PROJECT_TYPE: "GitHub Copilot CLI workshop"

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION: TEXT
A hands-on guide teaching developers how to use the Copilot CLI through 12 sequential modules covering installation, sessions, tools, MCP servers, skills, custom agents, hooks, and advanced topics.
>>

REPO_STRUCTURE: TEXT
- docs/workshop/ — Workshop modules numbered 00-13, designed to be followed in order
- docs/slides/ — Marp presentation slides (one per module), must stay in sync with workshop modules
- tryout/ — Scratch directory for workshop exercises (Docker-mounted workspace)
- .github/agents/ — Custom agents for workshop management and execution
>>

WORKSHOP_FLOW: "Installation (01) -> Core Concepts (02-05) -> Advanced (06-13)"
WORKSHOP_DURATION: "~4.5 hours"
MODULE_COUNT: 13
SLIDE_SYNC_RULE: "When modifying docs/workshop/NN-*.md, always check and update docs/slides/NN-*.md"
VALIDATED_CLI_VERSION: "1.0.57-5"

DOCKER_SETUP: TEXT
docker run -it --name copilot-workshop \
  -v "${HOST_PROJECT_PATH:-$(pwd)}/tryout":/workspace \
  -w /workspace ubuntu:24.04 bash

apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git jq gh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc && nvm install --lts
>>

CONVENTIONS: TEXT
- Module structure: each module follows Goal, Steps, Expected Outcome format
- Versionless documentation: describe current behavior as absolute and timeless; never reference version numbers
- Version tracking: VALIDATED_CLI_VERSION in copilot-instructions.md is the single source of truth; the README badge is derived from it
- Docker container: named copilot-workshop with tryout/ mounted at /workspace
>>

AGENTS: TEXT
- @workshop-content-manager: add, update, or remove content from workshop modules with source validation
- @workshop-runner: orchestrate full workshop execution via Docker container
- @module-executor: execute a single workshop module inside Docker (sub-agent of workshop-runner)
- @excali: generate Excalidraw diagrams from text descriptions
- @content-accuracy-checker: verify documented CLI behavior matches the current installed CLI
- @cross-reference-validator: validate links, structure, and agent map completeness across all modules
- @slide-sync-checker: verify slide decks stay in sync with workshop modules
- @exercise-linter: lint workshop exercises for syntax, numbering, and reference errors
- @content-refresher: orchestrate end-to-end content refresh across all agents
