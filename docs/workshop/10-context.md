- Use `/compact` to compress session history
- Use `@path/to/file` to include specific files in prompts
- Optimize context for better responses
- Manage large codebases efficiently

## Concepts

### What is Context?

Context is everything Copilot "remembers" during a session:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Context Window │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ System Instructions (AGENTS.md, etc.) │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Conversation History (prompts + responses) │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ File Contents (read during session) │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Tool Results (command outputs, etc.) │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Available Space for Response │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Token Limits

> [!NOTE]
> Use `/model` to select a model and `/context` to see context window usage. Run `/model` or `copilot help config` to see the current model list. Model availability may vary by Copilot subscription tier.

### Context Window Tier

You can select a context window tier for tiered-pricing models using the `--context` flag or the `contextTier` setting:

```bash
# Use long context mode for a session
copilot --context long_context

# Or set "contextTier": "long_context" in ~/.copilot/settings.json
```

Available tiers: `"default"` and `"long_context"`. The `/model` command shows a context tier picker for eligible models.

> [!WARNING]
> User settings belong in `~/.copilot/settings.json` — you can also edit them with `/settings`. The `~/.copilot/config.json` file next to it is managed automatically and stores your authentication token. Never print, paste, or share its contents, especially while screen-sharing.

### Including Files with `@`

You can include a specific file's contents in your prompt using `@` followed by the relative path:

```
Explain @config/ci/ci-required-checks.yml
```
```
Fix the bug in @src/app.js
```

When you start typing a file path after `@`, matching paths are displayed below the prompt box. Use the arrow keys to select a path and press Tab to complete it.

#### Expanded `@` Paths

> `@` file mentions support paths outside the project:

| Syntax | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@relative/path` | `@src/app.js` | Relative to project root (original) |
| `@/absolute/path` | `@/usr/local/config.yaml` | Absolute path |
| `@~/path` | `@~/notes/ideas.md` | Home directory path |
| `@../path` | `@../shared-lib/utils.js` | Relative parent path |

```
Review @~/company-standards/coding-guidelines.md and apply to this project
```

This is especially useful for referencing shared configuration, documentation, or libraries outside the current repository.

### Referencing GitHub Issues, PRs & Discussions with `#`

Similar to `@` for files, you can type `#` followed by a number to pull a GitHub issue, pull request, or discussion directly into context:

```
Summarize the discussion in #42
```
```
What's the status of #150 and are there related PRs?
```

When you type `#`, matching issues and PRs from the current repository are displayed below the prompt box. Use the arrow keys to select and press Tab to complete.

### Auto-Compaction

When context reaches ~95% capacity, Copilot automatically compresses history in the background without interrupting your workflow.

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Monitor Context Usage

**Goal:** Learn to track context consumption.

**Steps:**

1. Start a fresh session:
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```

2. Check initial context:
 ```
 /context
 ```

 You'll see a visual overview of your current token usage.

3. Check session stats with `/usage`:
 ```
 /usage
 ```

 You'll see:
 - AI credits used in the current session (premium requests are shown instead only on the legacy billing platform)
 - Session duration
 - Total lines of code edited
 - Token usage breakdown per model

4. Have a conversation that uses context:
 ```
 Explain the concept of dependency injection
 ```

5. Check context again:
 ```
 /context
 ```

6. Read some files (try using `@` to include a file):
 ```
 Show me the contents of package.json
 ```

7. Check how file reading affects context:
 ```
 /context
 ```

8. Continue building context:
 ```
 Now explain how TypeScript interfaces work
 ```
 ```
 Give me examples of generics in TypeScript
 ```

9. Monitor the growth:
 ```
 /context
 ```

**Expected Outcome:**
You understand how different actions consume context.

### Exercise 2: Manual Compaction

**Goal:** Use `/compact` to compress session history.

**Steps:**

1. Continue from Exercise 1 or start a session with significant history.

2. Check current context:
 ```
 /context
 ```

3. Run manual compaction:
 ```
 /compact
 ```

4. Check context after compaction:
 ```
 /context
 ```

5. Notice:
 - Token count decreased
 - Core information preserved
 - Detailed conversation history summarized

6. Verify context was preserved:
 ```
 What were we discussing earlier?
 ```

 Copilot should remember the key topics.

**Expected Outcome:**
Context reduced while preserving important information.

### Exercise 3: Context-Efficient Prompting

**Goal:** Learn to use context efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. **Inefficient approach** (uses lots of context):
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```
 ```
 Read all the files in the src directory and tell me what each one does
 ```

 This loads all files into context at once.

2. Check context:
 ```
 /context
 ```

3. Start a new session with efficient approach:
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```
 ```
 List the files in src directory
 ```

 Then selectively:
 ```
 Show me just the main entry point file
 ```

4. Compare context usage:
 ```
 /context
 ```

5. **Best practices for efficient context:**
 - Load files on-demand, not all at once
 - Use specific queries instead of broad exploration
 - Compact regularly during long sessions
 - Clear context when switching topics

**Expected Outcome:**
You can manage context efficiently.

### Exercise 4: Working with Large Codebases

**Goal:** Strategies for large projects without exhausting context.

**Steps:**

1. **Use the Explore agent for overview:**
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```
 ```
 Give me an overview of this codebase structure
 ```

 Copilot delegates to the Explore agent automatically, which doesn't pollute main context.
 it can also use GitHub MCP tools when available.

2. **Focus on specific areas:**
 ```
 I want to understand the authentication flow. What files should I look at?
 ```

3. **Read selectively:**
 ```
 Show me only the auth middleware file
 ```

4. **Use grep instead of reading entire files:**
 ```
 Search for "authenticate" in the codebase
 ```

5. **Clear when switching tasks:**
 ```
 /clear
 ```
 ```
 Now let's look at the database layer
 ```

6. **Leverage file-specific questions:**
 ```
 In src/db/connection.ts, how is the connection pool configured?
 ```

 Copilot reads only what's needed.

**Expected Outcome:**
Large codebases manageable without hitting limits.

### Exercise 5: Context Window Optimization

**Goal:** Configure for optimal context usage.

**Steps:**

1. **Choose the right model:**
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```
 ```
 /model
 ```

 Select a model with larger context if available.

2. **Use specific instructions:**

 Instead of:
 ```
 Tell me everything about this file
 ```

 Use:
 ```
 What does the processPayment function in payment.ts do?
 ```

3. **Batch related questions:**

 Instead of:
 ```
 What does function A do?
 What does function B do?
 What does function C do?
 ```

 Use:
 ```
 Explain functions A, B, and C in auth.ts
 ```

4. **Use references instead of copies:**
 ```
 Look at the PaymentService class - don't repeat the code, just explain the flow
 ```

5. **Summarize when appropriate:**
 ```
 Summarize what we've learned so far in 3 bullet points
 ```

 Then clear and continue with the summary as context.

**Expected Outcome:**
Maximum utility from available context.

### Exercise 6: Understanding Auto-Compaction

**Goal:** See auto-compaction in action.

**Steps:**

1. Start a session and fill context deliberately:
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```

2. Generate lots of content:
 ```
 Write a detailed explanation of microservices architecture with examples
 ```
 ```
 Now explain event-driven architecture in detail
 ```
 ```
 Compare REST vs GraphQL with code examples for both
 ```

3. Continue until you see auto-compaction trigger:
 ```
 Explain the CQRS pattern with implementation details
 ```

4. Watch for the auto-compaction message.

5. After compaction:
 ```
 /context
 ```

6. Verify continuity:
 ```
 What architectural patterns have we discussed?
 ```

**Expected Outcome:**
Auto-compaction preserves session continuity.

### Exercise 7: Context-Aware Workflow

**Goal:** Build a workflow that manages context intelligently.

**Steps:**

1. **Phase 1: Discovery (low context)**
 ```bash
 copilot
 ```
 ```
 What are the main components of this application?
 ```

 Copilot may delegate to the Explore agent, keeping main context clean.

2. **Phase 2: Focus (targeted context)**
 ```
 /clear
 ```
 ```
 Let's focus on the API layer. Show me the main router file.
 ```

3. **Phase 3: Deep dive (specific context)**
 ```
 I want to add a new endpoint. Show me an existing endpoint as a template.
 ```

4. **Phase 4: Implementation (working context)**
 ```
 Create a new endpoint for user preferences based on that pattern
 ```

5. **Phase 5: Cleanup (compact)**
 ```
 /compact
 ```
 ```
 Now let's write tests for the new endpoint
 ```

6. **Monitor throughout:**
 After each phase:
 ```
 /context
 ```

**Expected Outcome:**
Systematic workflow keeps context under control.

## Context Commands Reference

### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/context` | Show visual overview of token usage |
| `/usage` | Show session stats (requests, duration, lines edited, token usage per model) |
| `/compact` | Compress session history |
| `/clear` | Abandon session and start fresh (session is discarded) |
| `/new` | Start new conversation (old session stays backgrounded) |
| `/cwd` | Change working directory (affects context scope) |
| `/add-dir` | Add directory to accessible scope (persists across `/clear` and `/resume`; supports relative paths like `./src`) |
| `@path/to/file` | Include specific file contents in your prompt |
| `#<number>` | Include a GitHub issue, PR, or discussion in your prompt |

### Context Categories

| Category | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| System | Instructions, agents | Fixed overhead |
| History | Conversation turns | Grows with conversation |
| Files | Read file contents | Can be large |
| Tools | Command outputs | Varies by tool |
| Response | Space for answer | Reduces with context |

### Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `/clear` | Abandoning session entirely |
| `/new` | Starting new topic but keeping old session accessible |
| `/compact` | Long session, need to continue |
| Explore agent | Codebase overview without context cost |
| `@path/to/file` | Include specific files without broad reads |
| `#<number>` | Pull issue/PR/discussion context directly |
| Selective reading | Large files, specific needs |
| Summarization | Preserve knowledge, reduce tokens |

## Context Usage Tips

### Do ✅

- Check `/context` and `/usage` regularly
- Use `@path/to/file` to include specific files
- Use `#<number>` to reference GitHub issues, PRs, or discussions
- Compact before running out
- Clear when switching topics
- Use targeted queries
- Leverage the Explore agent for overview

### Don't ❌

- Read entire codebase at once
- Ask broad questions in large projects
- Let auto-compaction be your only strategy
- Repeat information already in context
- Ignore context warnings

## Summary

- ✅ Context is limited - monitor with `/context` and `/usage`
- ✅ `/compact` compresses while preserving key info
- ✅ `/clear` abandons the session; `/new` starts fresh while keeping the old session backgrounded
- ✅ Auto-compaction triggers at ~95% capacity
- ✅ Use `@path/to/file` to include specific files in prompts
- ✅ Use `#<number>` to pull GitHub issues, PRs, or discussions into context
- ✅ Efficient prompting extends useful session length
- ✅ Explore agent preserves main context
- ✅ `@` file mentions support absolute, home, and parent paths
- ✅ `--context` flag and the `contextTier` setting in `~/.copilot/settings.json` select the context window tier for eligible models
- ✅ Reasoning token usage shown in per-model breakdown via `/usage`
